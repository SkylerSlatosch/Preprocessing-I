      <h2>I AM THE TRUTH</h2>
        <p>
          Not too long ago children would would list their hero's, Spiderman, Superman, Spongebob, and the list would be endless with super humans who've achieved greatness. Now, children speak of Skyler Slatosch. The King of coding, the man who can conquer and rule all of the internet. Some might say he is of great intelligance, one thing we know for sure. When his name is spoken it is with only great stature and honor. Would you want to dissapoint your children? Not hiring their hero? I know I wouldn't. Hire the legend, hire the hero that goes by Skyler Slatosch. Do it for the children.

    <h2>MY PAST...</h2>
    <p>I have worked many places in my life, places that I am proud of and some I would rather not mention (there was some dark days). If you must know all of the land I have explored, conquered and experiences I have endoured; then so be it. I have ran acorss sea's, flew through the barriers of the earth as we know it. I took over sand castles all through out the galaxies, beaten children in pillow case races with ease. I have solved earths most difficult challenge, the Rubix Cube. Many have tried, many have failed but through perseverance I prevailed. These accomplishments make me blush from excitment, but there is one other side of my past... Some would call it "dirty" work but I, a man of entertaiment and love for acting. Am proud to say I was a fabulous stage dancer, the crowd went wild!! "yayyyyy!!" they cheered, "keep going!" they encouraged. So I did, and after a night of hard work, making people smile, I'd fly to the other galaxies for my next shifts. I am dedicated, tenacious and have a love for being the best I can be. This is, My Past.
